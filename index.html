										<p>I am very excited about applying for the next step of my IT education, being a very avid IT user with a wide interest in developing software. Ever since I discovered the ability to open game files and edit them, I have always wondered about how much I could customise and eventually develop custom games. Having previous experience of being taught about software development and games makes me even more excited to finally be able to test my abilities towards making my first official game, and seeing how many programming tools and tutorials there are out there really makes me look forward to experimenting and moving past some of my limits.</p>
                                        <p>I’ve always thought I would make a great game creator because I’m fantastic at adapting ideas and creating something new out of them. I am highly qualified to apply for courses requiring me to put my programming skills to the test, as I have recently graduated from a Level 5 HND course, achieving a pass grade. I also have a thorough understanding of computer security and networking, as I understand how to detect fraud and how to recover computer data safely.</p>
                                        <p>I have dabbled in website development before as well. Last year I was introduced to using CSS tools, which I have used to create a professional website which my tutor loved, managing to incorporate usage of both a navigation bar, as well as the box system to neatly lay everything out.
                                        I have a very active interest in playing games during my free time at home. I recently have started to explore new genres such as RPGs and Simulation games which I haven't really played before, as I've usually preferred to play Platformer and Open World games since my very early childhood.</p>
